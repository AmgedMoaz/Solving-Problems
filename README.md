This repository is mainly for learning and practice, but suggestions and improvements are always welcome.


🧩 Problem Solving Approach

Problem solving is a core skill in programming, and this repository focuses on developing that skill through continuous practice using C++ and Python.

C++ is used for high-performance solutions, understanding memory management, and applying advanced algorithms and data structures.

Python is used for writing clean, readable solutions and quickly implementing ideas and logic.

Each problem is solved with a clear approach, aiming to improve logical thinking, optimize performance, and build strong foundations for competitive programming and real-world problem solving.
